# Election_Analysis
Using Python to analyze election data

# Overview:
In this project, a Python script delivers an Election Audit across three candidates and three counties including:

- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout
- 
## Process & Data
1. A raw CSV file was imported to use data across ballot ID, county, and candidate name
2. Data was structured into Lists and Dictionaires
3. Decision statements (if), repetetion statements (for), and printing formats (f'{}) were structured to use correct syntax and spacing which would result in total votes, winning candidate, winning county, and winning percentages.
4. A text file was created to summarize election findings

### Be Careful!
*Spacing, Spacing, Spacing! When using Python, correct syntax and spacing is critical. Upon first run, incorrect results delivered due to an error in spacing:

*Psuedocode-Can't live with it, Can't live without it! Allocating correct variables with such a long code and many variables can be tricky, especially when tallying similiarites, in this example, votes. Although longer in process, adding in psuedocode refreshes the memory of why certain code was created

2. Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.
After running the Python script

How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
Which county had the largest number of votes?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

3. Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
